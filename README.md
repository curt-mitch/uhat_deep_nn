# UHaT Deep Neural Network
Creating a deep neural network for recognizing handwritten Urdu characters.

One intention for this project is to create a reasonably accurate neural network without using a DL framework such as Tensorflow or PyTorch.

The second is to use Keras/Tensorflow to train a model I can deploy as part of a full-stack web application.
